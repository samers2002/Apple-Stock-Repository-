- This repository was inpsired by the FAANG complete stock data [repositary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/faang-complete-stock-data?resource=download). The FAANG repository was about putting data of big companies that most people know about and are probably customers.
- I chose to take a deeper dive at this data and help filter it out for everyone so they can use it however they want. People can use this to make decisions about stocks, to understand trends in the market, and many other reasons.
- When I wanted to trade stocks, I found it very hard to find free websites that can guide me and present useful and relevant data. This repository is a step towards making and creating more free useful public information and more specifically business related information.
As menitoned earlier this information is for the benefit of the public, feel free to use content here and add and improve on it. Change starts with you!
