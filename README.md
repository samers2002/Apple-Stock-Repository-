This is a repository containing data set of the Apple Stock from 1980 until 2020. Apple is the biggest company in the world and has the largest market capitalization in the world. The US economy and market has a higher correlation with Apple's perfromance. Stocks is one way of measuring the performance with time. As a result, it is of importance to understand some trends of the Apple stock since 1980 and be able to detect some trends by filtering the data and creating visuals.

# Inspiration
- This repository was inpsired by the FAANG complete stock data [repositary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/faang-complete-stock-data?resource=download). The FAANG repository was about putting data of big companies that most people know about and are probably customers.
- I chose to take a deeper dive at this data and help filter it out for everyone so they can use it however they want. People can use this to make decisions about stocks, to understand trends in the market, and many other reasons.
- When I wanted to trade stocks, I found it very hard to find free websites that can guide me and present useful and relevant data. This repository is a step towards making and creating more free useful public information and more specifically business related information.


# Quick Note
As menitoned earlier this information is for the benefit of the public, feel free to use the content here. The goal of this reposiotry is to educate people about analyzing data themselves. Hopefully, this repositroy can benefit people and even build a community. While I chose one metric to filter the "Apple CSV", there are multiple different metrics to use when analayzing stocks.

While the US stock market consists of different indinces (group of stocks) one of the most famous one is called the S&P 500. The S&P 500 reflects the performance of these 500 companies and their stocks. However, not each company has the same weighting. Different weighting are given to companies that are bigger, more reputable, and better performing. This visual shows the weighting and it is clear that Apple has the highest weight. This is why Apple can be a good represntation of the market. The market and Apple stock have a pretty similar correlation, which is why this Apple repositiory is of importnace.
